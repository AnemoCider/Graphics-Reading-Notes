# Precomputed Lighting Advances in CoD

## Alternate Reconstruction of SH

One frequently used SH reconstruction algorithm is from Geometrics, 2017:

[Alternative definition of Spherical Harmonics for Lighting](https://grahamhazel.com/blog/2017/12/18/alternative-definition-of-spherical-harmonics-for-lighting/)

Basically it sacrifices some of the SH properties to get a much simpler formula, and thus cheaper evaluation.
